# Helium-Beta

This is the client-side application for Team Helium. 


## Type

Android Application

## Purpose 

Google Maps is a great way to find where to go, but when meeting friends it only tells us if we are in the right place and not how far from our friends we actually are. We could be going to a concert and be at the venue, but itâ€™ll be extremely hard to find your friend at the venue. With this application we hope to be able to not only help users get to the venue but also to find friends at the venue.
